# Project Overview
Welcome to the Tesla Stock Analysis and Prediction project! My name is WONG LI YING, in this repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Tesla's stock performance using various data analysis and visualization tools, along with a predictive model to forecast future stock prices.
# Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict the stock performance of Tesla using historical data. The analysis includes trend analysis, seasonal trend analysis, volatility analysis, and stock price prediction using an LSTM model.

# How to clone the repository?
git clone https://github.com/Liyingwong/Predicting-Tesla-s-Stock-Performance.git

# Tools and Technologies
Microsoft Excel: For initial data exploration and basic analysis.
Power BI: For creating dynamic visualizations and dashboards.
Python: For advanced data analysis and predictive modeling using Jupyter Notebook.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras.

# Data Source
The historical stock data for Tesla was sourced from Yahoo Finance, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

# Analysis and Findings
# Trend Analysis
30, 100, and 200 Days Moving Averages: Used to identify short-term and long-term trends.
# Seasonal Trend Analysis
Monthly Patterns: Identified recurring patterns to suggest optimal times for buying and selling.
# Volatility Analysis
Price Fluctuations: Highlighted the risk associated with Tesla's stock.
# Predictive Modeling
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model was employed to forecast future stock prices. The model demonstrated high accuracy, with a significant downturn predicted for January 2024.

# Conclusion and Recommendations
The analysis highlighted key trends and patterns in Tesla's stock performance. Based on our findings, we recommend diversification, seasonal investment strategies, leveraging predictive analytics, and continuous monitoring to optimize investment decisions.
